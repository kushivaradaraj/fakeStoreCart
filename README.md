# FakeStoreAPI

[FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com) is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need Pseudo-real data for
your e-commerce or shopping website without running any server-side code.
It's awesome for teaching purposes, sample codes, tests and etc.

## My Project

Developing a Springboot application that functions as a Cart Service, which internally makes API calls to the Fake Store API.
It has the following functionalities

--> Get all carts
--> Get cart by Id
--> Get cart by user id
--> Get cart in range of data
--> Adding a new cart
--> Updating a cart
--> Deleting a cart

### Get cart by id
